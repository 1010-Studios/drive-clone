A drive/dropbox clone, used to hone skills in React and begin learning Bootstrap and Firebase.

Current functionality: Upload files, delete files, create subdirectories, login/auth.

I started this project with a ~3 hour tutorial, making sure to be reading all applicable documentation. Doing so allowed me to continue to develop skills with authentication API's, reading/writing to a database, and Bootstrap for React.

I then expanded the functionality to include the ability to delete files, show thumbnails of images.
